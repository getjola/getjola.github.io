## What is Jola?
Jola is a website made for finding jobs and internships for highschool students. The idea for this project was the result of my poor experience with popular job websites made for a more older audience.

## How does Jola work?
Jola tries to find a job that is perfect for you. It will do this through multiple ways. Before you can look through listings you need to fill in a little form that will allow us to build a profile on you. After you have completed the form you'll be able to find jobs related to the answers you filled in.

## How does Jola boost my job application?
Jola offers many features that allows students to show who they really are to their potential employers. Jola can scan your transcript and highlight where you are strong in - and you're employer will see it. (Don't worry, we only share what you're doing great in - and you will always get a preview of what the employer is going to see)

## Why should I hire staff through Jola?
If you're looking for a very specific type of person - Jola offers you plenty of options to choose from. You'll have access to loads of talent - and they will eagerly work for you.
